# Solidity Personal Notes 

# Folder Structure
File in Solidity:

.sol file extension used for writing smart contracts.
Example: MyContract.sol.
Key Folders:

Contract Folder: Contains Solidity contract files (e.g., Token.sol).
Scripts Folder: Holds scripts for deploying and interacting with contracts (e.g., deploy.js).
Tests Folder: Contains test scripts, typically written in JavaScript/TypeScript, to validate contracts.
Artifacts Folder: Stores compiled contract files (ABI and bytecode), usually under the contracts folder.

# Key Solidity Concepts
1. Variables:
Variables store data in smart contracts:

Address: Stores Ethereum addresses.
Example: address owner;
String: Stores text.
Example: string public name;
Unsigned Integer (uint): Non-negative numbers (e.g., uint256, uint8).
Example: uint256 public totalSupply;
Boolean (bool): Stores true or false.
Example: bool public isActive;
2. Visibility Types:
Defines who can access a function or variable:

Public: Accessible by anyone.
Example: function getValue() public view returns (uint256);
Private: Only accessible within the same contract.
Example: function _internalLogic() private;
Internal: Accessible by the contract and derived contracts.
Example: function setOwner() internal;
External: Callable only by other contracts or external accounts.
Example: function interact() external;
3. Mapping:
A key-value store for efficient lookups.
Example:

solidity
Copy code
mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
balances[msg.sender] = 1000; // Assign a balance
4. Arrays:
Stores collections of values:

Fixed-size: uint[5] fixedArray;
Dynamic: uint[] public dynamicArray;
5. Structs:
Custom data types grouping multiple variables.
Example:

solidity
Copy code
struct User {
    address userAddress;
    string username;
    uint256 age;
}
User[] public users;


Functionality in Solidity
1. require Statement:
Enforces conditions. Fails the transaction if not met.
Example:

solidity
Copy code
require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
2. Modifier:
Reusable logic applied to functions.
Example:

solidity
Copy code
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
    _;
}
function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
    // Logic here
}
3. Constructor:
Initializes the contract during deployment.
Example:

solidity
Copy code
constructor(string memory _name) {
    name = _name;
}
4. Events:
Logs data on the blockchain, useful for notifications.
Example:

solidity
Copy code
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount);
emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
DApps (Decentralized Applications)
What is a DApp?
A web application that interacts with a smart contract on the blockchain.

Components:

HTML, CSS, JS: Build the UI.
ABI (Application Binary Interface): Acts as the interface between the DApp and the contract.
Web3.js: JavaScript library to connect to Ethereum.
Example Setup:

javascript
Copy code
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);
Advanced Solidity Features
1. Loops:
Supports for, while, and do-while.
Example:

solidity
Copy code
for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Logic here
}
2. Inheritance:
Allows contracts to inherit behavior from others using the is keyword.
Example:

solidity
Copy code
contract Parent {
    function greet() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello!";
    }
}
contract Child is Parent {
    // Inherits greet()
}
Use super to call a parentâ€™s function: super.greet();
3. Import Statements:
Imports code from other files.
Example:

solidity
Copy code
import "./ParentContract.sol";
4. Contract Interaction:
Contracts can call other contracts.
Example:

solidity
Copy code
interface Token {
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external;
}
contract MyContract {
    function sendToken(address _contract, address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
        Token(_contract).transfer(_to, _amount);
    }
}
